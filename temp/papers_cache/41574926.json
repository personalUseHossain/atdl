  "abstract": "Oxidative stress and enhanced free radical production with subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration are major pathomechanisms for the ageing spectrum of neurocognitive disorders ranging from subjective cognitive decline over mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and vascular dementia (VD). Due to its radical scavenging, antioxidative and mitochondrial function-improving properties standardised Ginkgo biloba extracts (GBE) target several key processes of neurodegeneration. These include mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired mitochondrial quality control, and reduced energy metabolism. GBE's benefits also include supporting neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to form new neural connections, and reducing neuroinflammation, a major driver of disease progression in neurodegenerative conditions. As a consequence, GBE improves several aspects of cognitive dysfunction within the broad spectrum of neurocognitive disorders as indicated by a large body of evidence from randomised controlled studies.",
